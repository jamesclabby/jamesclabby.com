                Outside of work, I enjoy surfing, poker, college football (Go Irish!), and spending quality time with family and friends.  
                I was born and raised in Manasquan, NJ and currently live in NYC.

          <div class="space-y-4">
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
              I'm driven by bridging the gap between what people truly need and what technology can deliver. 
              My approach starts with genuine empathy—listening deeply to uncover the underlying problems users are trying to solve, then translating those insights into clear, actionable solutions that engineering teams can build.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
              What energizes me most is orchestrating the complex dance of stakeholders, timelines, and technical constraints to bring meaningful solutions to life. 
              I thrive on being the connective tissue between customer insights and development execution. 
              There's something uniquely rewarding about seeing a customer's frustration transform into delight because we took the time to truly understand their world and built something that fits seamlessly into it.
