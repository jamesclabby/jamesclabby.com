Built with modern web technologies, it provides an intuitive interface for managing product roadmaps, prioritizing features based on various criteria, and facilitating team collaboration throughout the product development lifecycle.\n\n### Tech Stack\n\nThe application leverages a modern, scalable technology stack:\n\n- **Frontend**: React for a responsive and interactive user interface\n- **Backend**: Node.js and Express for a robust API infrastructure  \n- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon for reliable and scalable data storage\n- **Email**: Resend for seamless email communications and notifications\n- **Authentication**: Firebase for secure user authentication\n- **AI Integration**: Custom AI chat assistant for feature analytics and bulk operations via the OpenAI API\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Feature Prioritization Matrix**: Advanced scoring system with customizable criteria including business value, technical complexity, and user impact\n- **Interactive Roadmap Planning**: Drag-and-drop interface for organizing features by status and parent-child relationships\n- **AI Chat Assistant**: Seamless and lightweight AI chat assistant that can generate analytics and create/edit features\n- **Team Collaboration Tools**: Real-time commenting, voting, and feedback collection on proposed features\n- **Team Management**: Create and manage teams by adding/removing users via fast email invites\n- **Data-Driven Insights**: Analytics dashboard showing feature performance metrics and team productivity\n- **Customizable Workflows**: Flexible approval processes and status tracking tailored to your team's needs\n- **Automated Notifications**: Smart email alerts for mentions in comments and team invites\n\n## The Story Behind FeatureForge\n\n### My First Dive into \"Vibe Coding\"\n\nFeatureForge was my first experiment with AI-assisted development, or as some call it, \"vibe coding.\" I know what you might be thinking—isn't vibe coding just a fad that produces poor, unorganized, and unmaintainable code? \n\nWhile that can certainly be true if you rush through development without understanding your codebase, my approach was different. When I started building FeatureForge, I had only limited coding experience beyond college courses and the occasional Python script for work automation. But I was determined to learn the entire product development lifecycle: from problem identification to implementation to release.\n\n### My Approach: Slow and Deliberate\n\nMy philosophy for AI-assisted development is simple:\n\n- **Take it slow** and think deeply about each change\n- **Ask for small, incremental updates** rather than large feature dumps\n- **Demand explanations** and testing for every modification\n- **Spend more time thinking** than coding\n\nThis project took me several months of consistent work, but most of my time was spent thinking—about user needs, feature purposes, and architectural decisions. This deliberate approach allowed me to make meaningful, incremental progress while truly understanding my codebase.\n\n### Solving Real Problems\n\nBeyond learning, I wanted to create something that product teams would actually use. After 3+ years at Princeton Consultants using Jira daily, I've experienced firsthand how feature-heavy tools can become cluttered and overwhelming.\n\n**The Problem**: Existing tools like Jira have so many features that users often feel pigeonholed into using just a fraction of their capabilities.\n\n**My Solution**: Create something lightweight and minimalistic that still provides everything product teams need:\n- Feature request creation and management\n- Team collaboration tools\n- Progress and productivity tracking\n- An interface that makes users feel they're getting full value from the product\n\n### Where FeatureForge Stands Today\n\nI won't claim FeatureForge is ready for millions of users, but it's something I'm genuinely proud of—something I'd actually use myself and can continue building upon as I grow as a developer.\n\n**If you're reading this, I encourage you to give it a try!** Don't hesitate to share feedback, whether positive or constructive.
